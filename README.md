# US-AI-Server-Analysis
This study unveils the energy/water/climate impact of AI servers in the U.S. from 2024 to 2030 and highlight the emergent actions required from both the governmental and industrial bodies. The following contents are included in this repository to support our key findings:
1. Codes: include major codes to conduct the estimation process.
2. Data: include all data used during the analysis.

## Requirements
To run the codes in this repository, the following Python and core packages must be installed (version is given for refenrence):
- Python 3.9.13
- numpy 1.21.5
- pyomo 6.5.0 with ipopt solver
- csv 1.0
- cyipopt 1.1.0

## Codes
- **Best&Worst PUE and WUE.py**: This file contains the calculation process for generating the best and worst PUE and WUE cases for AI data centers.
- **GBE.py**: This file provides the detailed process for developing the generalized Bass model used in this study.
- **Main.py**: This file runs a basic procedure for generating the energy/water/carbon footprints of AI servers in the U.S. from 2024 to 2030.
- **Spatial Distribution Analysis.py**: This file presents the calculation process for generating better AI server spatial allocation strategies.
- **simulation_funs_DC_i.py**: This file defines the basic functions for evaluating the PUE and WUE values of AI data centers.

## Data
- **PUE and WUE values of each grid cell in the U.S.**: Best_PUE.csv, Best_WUE.csv, PUE_WUE_Density.xlsx, Worst_PUE.csv, Worst_WUE.csv
- **Carbon emission per unit of electricity data of each U.S. region from 2024 to 2030**: Unit Emission Best.txt, Unit Emission Worst.txt, Unit Emission.txt
- **Water usage per unit of electricity data of each U.S. region from 2024 to 2030**: Unit Water Best.txt, Unit Water Worst.txt, Unit Water.txt
- **Temporal scenario generated by the Bass model**: Unit Temporal Scenario.csv
- **Spatial allocation ratio of each U.S. states**: states_spatial_scenario_frozen.txt

## Running the code
### Running the base case
The file **Main.py** can be used to run a base case for estimating the energy/water/carbon footprints of AI servers in the U.S. from 2024 to 2030. After download the codes and data, simply replace the "FILE PATH" used in the **Main.py** file with the install path of our data folder to run the simulation.
### Running the best/worst cases
The best/worst cases for industry efficiency efforts and grid developments can be completed by replace the data file used or influential factor defined in **Main.py**. For spatial distribution analysis, please use the codes provided in **Spatial Distribution Analysis.py** to calculate the location information for replacing the spatial distribution codes in **Main.py**.
